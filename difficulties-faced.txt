1. The banner section has a plane backgruond. I faced diffuculty putting the poster image as the background, could not make the banner video background transparent. 
2. Have not implemented the javascript [clickables], as the assignment was intended for the html and css part.
3. The whatsapp icon on the right does not have an opaque background and the appearance of it just after the scrolling of the banner section has not been achieved. 
4. The fixing of the sticky positioned nav bar is not changing background color when fixed on the top.
